# Fantasy Extension

This skill extends the base Immersive Prose Engine with fantasy-specific rules for magic, mythic creatures, and supernatural elements.

## Core Principle: Magic as Material Process

Magic in fantasy must follow the same physicality rules as technology in sci-fi. It is not exempt from the Law of Persistence.

---

## Genre-Specific Rules

### 1. Magic Systems

**Magic has Physical Cost:**
- Blood, exhaustion, material components, sanity, lifespan
- Cost must be paid *during* or *immediately after* casting
- Costs persist across scenes (fatigue, injury, resource depletion)

**Spells are Procedural, Not Instant:**
- Describe the steps: gathering energy, speaking words, physical gestures
- Include sensory markers: heat, cold, light, sound, smell
- Show the lag between initiation and effect

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "She cast a fireball."

**Use:** "She pressed her palms together, the friction building heat between them. The air around her hands shimmered, then ignited with a sharp crack. Flame pooled in her cupped palms, the heat searing her skin. She threw it forward, the fireball trailing smoke and embers."

**Cost Application:** "Her hands trembled, the skin red and blistered. The smell of burnt flesh mixed with ozone."

### 2. Magical Items

**Describe Physical Reality Before Naming:**
- Material, weight, temperature, texture
- How it interacts with light, sound, or touch
- Function revealed through use, not label

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "He picked up the Wand of Storms."

**Use:** "He picked up the rod. It was carved from blackened wood, heavier than it looked, with silver wire spiraling up its length. When his fingers touched the wire, a faint vibration hummed through his palm, like distant thunder trapped in the grain."

### 3. Mythic Creatures

**Sensory Markers Before Species:**
- Describe what the POV character *perceives*: scales, heat, smell, sound
- Use the Three-Step Reveal: Symptom → Reaction → Action
- Only name the species if the character has established knowledge

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "A dragon landed in front of him."

**Use:** "The ground shook. He looked up. Something massive descended from the clouds, wings the size of sails beating the air into a gale. Scales caught the light—dark green, overlapping like roof tiles. Heat radiated from its body, a furnace-warmth that made the air shimmer. When it landed, the impact sent cracks spidering through the stone."

**Recognition (if applicable):** "A dragon. He'd seen the drawings in the garrison library, but the sketches hadn't captured the weight of it, the way its breath smelled of sulfur and ash."

### 4. Supernatural Forces

**Ghosts, Spirits, Curses:**
- Describe the *effect* on the environment or character, not the entity directly
- Cold spots, flickering lights, objects moving, sensory distortions
- Characters react to symptoms before understanding the cause

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "A ghost appeared."

**Use:** "The temperature dropped. His breath misted. The candle flame bent sideways, pulled by a draft that didn't exist. Then he saw it—a shape in the corner, translucent, edges blurred like smoke. It didn't move, but the air around it rippled."

### 5. Fantasy Worldbuilding

**Deliver Through Habit and Scarcity:**
- Magic is regulated, taxed, or forbidden → show enforcement, paperwork, black markets
- Mythic creatures are rare → show the reaction when one appears
- Ancient ruins hold power → show the decay, the warnings, the cost of entry

**Systemic Pressure Examples:**
- A mage guild that controls spell licenses
- A kingdom where iron is banned because it disrupts magic
- A forest where the trees are sentient and hostile

---

## Fantasy-Specific Anti-Patterns

**Avoid:**
- Instant, costless magic
- Naming creatures/spells before describing them
- Magic as plot convenience (no setup, no cost)
- Exposition about the magic system through dialogue
- Characters immune to magical consequences

---

## Quality Control Additions

In addition to the base engine checklist, verify:

- [ ] **Magic Cost Check:** Did every spell/magical action have a physical cost?
- [ ] **Creature Description Check:** Did I describe the creature's physical presence before naming it?
- [ ] **Material Magic Check:** Did I describe magical items by their physical properties first?
- [ ] **Persistence Check:** Do magical costs (exhaustion, injury) carry into the next scene?
- [ ] **Systemic Magic Check:** Does the magic system create friction, not convenience?
