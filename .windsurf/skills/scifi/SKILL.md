# Sci-Fi Extension

This skill extends the base Immersive Prose Engine with sci-fi-specific rules for technology, space environments, and futuristic systems.

## Core Principle: Technology as Tactile Reality

Technology must be grounded in physical interaction. No instant solutions, no magic-like tech. Everything has procedural steps, failure modes, and resource costs.

## Genre-Specific Rules

### 1. Technology & Devices

**Describe Material, Not Function:**
- Weight, texture, temperature, interface elements
- How it feels in the hand, sounds when activated, smells when overheating
- Function revealed through use, not exposition

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "She activated the plasma cutter."

**Use:** "She gripped the handle—polymer, textured for grip, warm from the battery pack. She pressed the trigger. The tool whined, building charge, then a thin beam of superheated gas hissed from the emitter. The air around it shimmered with heat."

**Technology Has Lag and Failure:**
- Boot sequences, loading times, calibration delays
- Overheating, battery drain, signal interference
- Errors, crashes, manual overrides

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "He hacked the door."

**Use:** "He pulled the panel off the wall, exposing the circuit board. The interface flickered to life, lines of code scrolling past. He tapped commands, waiting for the system to respond. The door's lock cycled once, twice, then jammed. He swore, rerouted power, tried again. The lock disengaged with a mechanical thunk."

### 2. Spacecraft & Vehicles

**Procedural Operation:**
- Pre-flight checks, startup sequences, system diagnostics
- G-forces, vibration, engine noise, temperature changes
- Fuel consumption, life support monitoring, course corrections

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "The ship took off."

**Use:** "She ran through the pre-flight checklist, fingers moving over switches and dials. The engines rumbled to life, a deep vibration that shook the deck plating. She pushed the throttle forward. The ship lifted, gravity pulling at her chest as they climbed. The altimeter spun upward. Outside, the atmosphere thinned, the sky darkening from blue to black."

**Space is Hostile:**
- Vacuum, radiation, temperature extremes
- Life support systems are constant background pressure
- Decompression, hull breaches, oxygen depletion are real threats

### 3. AI & Synthetic Characters

**Physical Presence First:**
- Describe the hardware: chassis, joints, optical sensors, speaker grilles
- Movement quality: smooth vs. jerky, silent vs. mechanical
- Voice characteristics: synthesized tone, pitch, cadence

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "The AI spoke."

**Use:** "The speaker grille on the wall crackled. A voice emerged, flat and synthesized, each syllable precisely enunciated. 'Warning. Hull integrity at seventy-two percent.'"

**For Androids/Robots:**
- Describe the uncanny valley: too smooth, too perfect, wrong temperature
- Micro-movements that reveal artificiality: no breathing, no blinking, precise repetition

### 4. Cybernetics & Augmentation

**Integration Has Cost:**
- Surgical scars, rejection symptoms, maintenance requirements
- Neural lag, phantom sensations, calibration drift
- Power consumption, overheating, system conflicts

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "His cybernetic arm was strong."

**Use:** "He flexed his right hand. The fingers responded, servos whirring beneath the synthetic skin. The connection point at his shoulder ached—a dull, constant throb where flesh met metal. He could feel the weight of it, heavier than bone, the balance always slightly off."

### 5. Hacking & Digital Intrusion

**Procedural, Not Instant:**
- Interface with physical terminals, data ports, wireless signals
- Firewalls as obstacles with specific countermeasures
- Time pressure: detection algorithms, trace programs, lockout timers

**Examples:**

**Avoid:** "She hacked the mainframe."

**Use:** "She jacked the cable into the port, the connection clicking home. Her visor lit up with the network map—nodes branching like a nervous system. She navigated to the security layer, fingers dancing over the haptic interface. The firewall pushed back, code fragmenting her intrusion. She rerouted, tried a different vector. The system flagged her. Thirty seconds until lockout."

### 6. Sci-Fi Worldbuilding

**Deliver Through Infrastructure and Regulation:**
- Megacities: vertical stratification, air quality, light pollution
- Space stations: rotation for gravity, recycled air, water rationing
- Corporate control: branding everywhere, surveillance, access restrictions
- Post-scarcity or scarcity: how resources are distributed or fought over

**Systemic Pressure Examples:**
- A surveillance state where every transaction is logged
- A colony where oxygen is metered and expensive
- A ship where the AI controls life support and has its own agenda

## Sci-Fi-Specific Anti-Patterns

**Avoid:**
- Instant technology (no boot time, no lag, no failure)
- Naming tech before describing it physically
- Technology as plot convenience (no setup, no cost)
- Exposition about how tech works through dialogue
- Characters immune to environmental hazards (vacuum, radiation, etc.)

## Quality Control Additions

In addition to the base engine checklist, verify:

- [ ] **Tech Description Check:** Did I describe devices by material/interface before naming them?
- [ ] **Procedural Tech Check:** Did technology have lag, failure modes, or resource costs?
- [ ] **Environment Check:** Did space/hostile environments exert constant pressure?
- [ ] **System Cost Check:** Do cybernetics, hacking, or AI interactions have physical/procedural costs?
- [ ] **Persistence Check:** Do tech failures or resource depletion carry into the next scene?
