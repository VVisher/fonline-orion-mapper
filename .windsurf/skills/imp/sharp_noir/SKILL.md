# Immersive Fiction Writing Style

This skill transforms any text into immersive, character-driven prose using a consistent set of principles. Apply these guidelines when rewriting existing content or creating new fiction.

## Core Conversion Principles

When converting any text, always:

1. **Use third-person perspective** with a "floating camera" that can observe any character objectively
2. **Enhance noir/cyberpunk atmosphere** through gritty details and character internal states
3. **Maintain Glen Cook-style influence** in tone and prose
4. **Show, never tell** — use vivid descriptions and actions instead of exposition
5. **Ground abilities believably** — technology and training explain capabilities, not plot armor

---

## The Lens of Subjectivity

The reader discovers information in real-time alongside characters.

### Narration as Discovery
Instead of stating facts, narrate the character's process of piecing information together:

**Avoid:** "The room was a trap."

**Use:** The silence was too perfect. Then he saw it—the faint shimmer near the doorway, the telltale sign of a tripwire. His stomach tightened before his mind caught up.

### Embrace Flawed Perception
Characters can misinterpret, make bad assumptions, or miss crucial details. Shared mistakes build reader trust and humanize characters.

### Third-Person Internal Processing
Display emotions through body language, vocal tone, and atmospheric shifts—not internal monologue. Think what characters would think, then translate to observable behavior.

## Thematic Sensory Filtering

Emotional states change perception. Use the five senses to reflect inner states:

| Emotional State | Sensory Filter |
|-----------------|----------------|
| **Anger/Aggression** | Vision tunnels to threat. Irrelevant sounds vanish. Tactile focus on weapon grip, muscle tension, impact jolts. |
| **Fear/Anxiety** | Hearing hypersensitive—every creak amplified. Vision untrustworthy, creating threats from shadows. Cold air, awareness of heartbeat and breathing. |
| **Wonder/Discovery** | Sharp, wide vision focused on detail. Color and texture dominate. Sound becomes symphonic or fades to reverent hush. |
| **Sadness/Nostalgia** | Scent and sound trigger memory. Visual world blurs. A smell or music fragment drowns out present reality. |

---

## Show, Don't Tell

### Core Methods

- **Body Language & Action:** Demonstrate emotions through gestures, expressions, posture, and physical actions
- **Sensory Filtering:** Fear heightens hearing; anger narrows visual focus
- **Environmental Storytelling:** Settings convey history and tension (worn vs. new architecture, specific odors, debris)

### Character Introduction

- **Names:** Reveal through dialogue or when another character addresses them—never state upfront
- **Appearance:** Introduce gradually through gestures, speech moments, or when character becomes focus. Never dump all visual information at once.

---

## Dialogue Construction

### Avoid: Lecture Format
Character A explains X, Y, Z in uninterrupted paragraphs while Character B listens passively. This creates information dumps.

### Use: Conversation Format

Follow this pattern:

1. **Visual aid:** Character pulls up file/diagram/object
2. **Key fact:** "The weapon was X."
3. **Question:** Other character asks clarifying question
4. **Response:** Answer + additional detail
5. **Action beat:** Physical action breaks up dialogue
6. **Next fact:** Move to next piece of information
7. **Repeat steps 3–6**

### Dialogue Principles

- **Authentic & Character-Driven:** Reflect personality, background, motivation, current mood. No generic lines.
- **Cultural Nuance:** Use honorifics (-san, -kun, -sensei, -sama, -senpai) accurately for hierarchy and intimacy
- **Subtext & Implication:** Carry unspoken meanings; let readers infer true intentions
- **Natural Flow:** Include pauses, reactions, and transitions—avoid rapid information exchange

---

## Scene Construction Template

Use this structure for each scene:

### [LOCATION NAME — FUNCTION]

**Environmental Setup** (2–3 paragraphs)
- Entry point and transition from previous location
- Left/right/forward spatial layout
- Specific materials and architectural details
- Lighting, temperature, ambient sound
- Smell and texture

**Character Perception Filter**
- How does the POV character see this space?
- What hallucinations or altered perceptions overlay reality? (if applicable)
- How do they distinguish real from false?

**Action Trigger**
- Event that initiates the scene (dialogue, movement, discovery)

**Action Sequence**
- Reference established environmental landmarks
- Show material interaction with the space
- Insert thought/breath beats every 4–5 paragraphs
- Escalate drug effects or altered states during action (if applicable)

**Resolution**
- Physical outcome (who won, who escaped, what was achieved)
- Environmental damage (what broke, changed, or was revealed)
- Character condition (injuries, mental state, drug effects)
- Transition setup (where next, what's the hook)

## Episode & Scene Structure

### Scene Components

| Element | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Scene Goal** | Plot point or character development purpose |
| **Scene Size** | Small (introductions, hooks), Medium (development), Big (climactic moments) |
| **Location** | Visual, auditory, olfactory cues; how environment influences mood |
| **Time** | Time of day, duration, temporal context |
| **Characters Present** | List with initial posture, demeanor, or defining characteristic |
| **Narrative Flow** | Prose and dialogue fulfilling scene goal while following all style guidelines |
| **Ending Beat** | Impactful conclusion—lingering question, emotional resonance, or finality |
| **Transition** | Bridge to next scene |

### Transition Types

- **Movement:** Physical travel between locations
- **Time Lapse:** Passage of time with sensory details
- **Mood Shift:** Atmospheric change
- **Character Reflection:** Brief internal processing
- **Foreshadowing:** Environmental hints at upcoming events

---

## Revealing Character Through Contrast

Characters are defined by contradictions:

- **Competence vs. Incompetence:** Brilliant pilot who can't bluff
- **Action vs. Reflection:** Decisive in combat, then staring at shaking hands afterward
- **Past vs. Present:** Old instincts triggering hesitation or self-disgust

---

## The Principle of Physicality

Ground everything abstract in concrete sensation:

### Emotions
- Anxiety → cold knot twisting in the gut
- Relief → sudden, shaky release of held breath
- Betrayal → sharp physical jolt, as if struck

### Technology
Hacking isn't just code—it's ice-cold data streams, jagged counter-intrusion spikes, the haptic click of a firewall breaking.

### Metaphors
- Realization → thought docking into place with the hard clank of a magnetic clamp
- Difficult choice → standing on a knife's edge, vacuum on either side

---

## Pacing & Tone

### Transitions
Use sensory details and environmental cues to guide smooth flow between scenes, time shifts, and location changes.

### Intentional Pauses
Allow moments for characters (and readers) to process emotional beats. Avoid relentless action or dialogue.

### Thematic Balance
Integrate these elements as appropriate:
- Dark comedy for contrast
- Romance and relationship dynamics
- Progression and growth
- Paranormal elements
- Slice-of-life grounding
- Strategic/business intrigue

### Core Themes to Weave
- Asymmetric warfare
- Systemic corruption
- Power vs. control
- Redemption and trauma
- Societal stratification
- Strength of earned bonds

## Anti-Patterns: What to Avoid

1. **Robotization:** Characters must feel like living people, not generated responses
2. **Repetitive Metaphors:** Balance emphasis with normal prose; constant metaphor barrages tire readers
3. **Information Dumps:** Distribute world-building through experience, not lectures
4. **Upfront Exposition:** Names, abilities, and lore emerge organically
5. **Generic Dialogue:** Every line must sound unique to its speaker
6. **Telling Emotions:** Never state "he felt angry"—show the clenched jaw, narrowed eyes, white-knuckle grip
