# Fiction Writing Skill: Systemic Realism & Immersive Prose

## Skill Summary

This skill applies **systemic, immersive realism** to fiction across genres. It focuses on believable worlds that progress independently of protagonists, action grounded in physical and logistical consequence, and prose that conveys meaning through behavior, environment, and aftermath rather than exposition.

Use this skill when writing, rewriting, or editing fiction that must feel *lived-in*, coherent under pressure, and resistant to common failures such as info-dumping, protagonist-centric plotting, or theatrical but weightless action.

## Core Principles (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **World Moves Without the Protagonist**  
   Events, institutions, and crises continue regardless of the main character’s presence or success. The narrative may intersect with them, but does not cause them to exist.

2. **Competence Without Exceptionalism**  
   Characters are trained, experienced, or practiced — not chosen, exempt, or narratively protected. Survival does not imply moral correctness.

3. **Action as Process, Not Spectacle**  
   Violence, crisis, and decision-making are treated as logistical sequences with cost, fatigue, injury, and imperfect outcomes.

4. **Show, Don’t Explain**  
   Information is conveyed through consequence, reaction, omission, and environment. Direct explanation is a last resort.

5. **Repeatable, Load‑Bearing Prose**  
   Sentence structure and descriptive density are designed to hold under sustained action, long projects, and frequent output.

## Execution Protocol: Material Handling

This section defines how the skill transforms user input into finished prose.

- **If input is a Summary or Outline:** Expand it into a full scene using the *Scene Construction* framework below.
- **If input is Existing Prose:** Rewrite to eliminate protagonist-centric causality, abstract emotion, and weightless action.
- **The Grit Pass (Mandatory):**
  - Scan for abstract states (e.g., *tired, angry, afraid*).
  - Replace them with physical, procedural, or sensory markers that imply the state through behavior.

## Systemic Pressure Reference

The world must exert pressure independently of the protagonist.

| Narrative Element | Systemic Realism Treatment |
|-------------------|----------------------------|
| **Antagonist** | Occupied with their own logistics, timelines, or failures; not waiting for the protagonist. |
| **Crowd** | Individuals have destinations, obligations, and indifference; reactions are delayed or self-interested. |
| **Equipment** | Tools have weight, require maintenance, consume resources, and can fail at inconvenient moments. |
| **The Law / Authority** | Bureaucracy and enforcement act as friction, delay, or misalignment—not as narrative tools. |

## Narrative Perspective & Information Control

### Third‑Person, Limited by Perception
- Camera follows what can be reasonably perceived.
- No omniscient moral framing.
- Knowledge is partial, delayed, or inferred.

### Discovery Over Declaration

Apply the **Three-Step Reveal** instead of direct statements:

1. **Environmental Symptom** — a sensory or physical anomaly.
2. **Character Reaction** — instinctive movement or adjustment.
3. **Physical Action** — a decision enacted through the body.

Avoid stating conclusions the reader can infer.
**Avoid:** “This was a trap.”  
**Use:** Physical or behavioral cues that allow the reader to reach that conclusion.

### Flawed Interpretation
Characters misread situations, act on bad assumptions, or lack context. The narrative does not correct them immediately.

---

## Physicality as the Translation Layer

All abstractions must be rendered physical.

### Emotion
- Fear → altered breathing, sensory overload
- Anger → narrowed attention, loss of fine control
- Shock → delay, ringing silence, slowed response

### Thought
Thinking is shown through hesitation, repetition, fixation, or premature action — not internal essays.

### Technology / Systems
Systems resist, lag, fail, or demand tradeoffs. Interaction has tactile or procedural markers.

---

## Procedural Cost Tracking (Law of Persistence)

All costs persist beyond the scene in which they occur.

- **Injury & Fatigue:** Physical damage, exhaustion, or impairment in one scene must limit capability in subsequent scenes.
- **Resource Depletion:** Track ammunition, fuel, power, time, light, and attention. Consumption forces environmental change.
- **Temporal Pressure:** Time spent produces consequences (darkness, shift changes, missed windows).

The narrative must not reset character capacity between scenes.

---

## Scene Construction (Flexible Framework)

### 1. Orientation
- How the scene is entered (movement, interruption, aftermath)
- Spatial clarity: relative positions, materials, scale
- Spatial Anchor: to enrich scenes, establish environmental element that is actively changing or operating independently of the character (e.g., a leaking pipe, wind or rain, a distant siren, a flickering advertisement).

### 2. Perceptual Filter
- What the POV character notices *first* and *misses entirely*
- Emotional or physical state shaping perception

### 3. Trigger
- The event that forces action, choice, or reaction

### 4. Sequence
- Actions tied to established space and constraints
- Costs accumulate (time, injury, exposure, resources)

### 5. Outcome
- What changed in the world
- What damage remains
- What was *not* resolved

### 6. Transition
- Movement, time lapse, or consequence carrying forward

---

## Protocol: Perspective Persistence & Identification

### The Identification Threshold

 - Characters & Items: Must be identified by a Physical Signature, Function, or Material until their name is explicitly used in the world (spoken, read on a badge/label, seen on a screen, or recognized through a specific, established habit).
- The Recognition Rule: A POV character can only "name" an item immediately if it is a common object (e.g., a chair, a knife) or part of their established Competence (e.g., a soldier recognizing a Standard Issue Pulse-Rifle).

### Frequency of Epithets (The Rotation)

- Avoid repeating the same physical signature, which leads to "stilted" prose. 
- Rotate through observations based on the Sensory Filter:

**Person**: the man in the suit → the guest speaker → the stranger → Vane.
**Item**: the heavy metallic cylinder → the device → the humming canister → the 'Wunderwaffle'.

### Handling "New Words" & Technical Lore

- **No Omni-Knowledge**: If the POV character doesn't know what a device is, the narration cannot name it. It must be described by its Tactile or Procedural Markers.
- **Avoid**: "He picked up the Neuro-Linker."
- **Use**: "He picked up the headpiece. It was a mesh of silver filaments that pulsed with a faint, rhythmic heat against his palm.".

### Discovery Over Declaration: 

Use the Three-Step Reveal for items:

- Symptom: The item makes a sound, has a weight, or catches the light.
- Reaction: Character adjusts their grip or squints at a display.
- Action: The character uses the item, revealing its function through Process, Not Spectacle.

## Dialogue: Information Under Friction

### Core Rules
- Dialogue exists to *collide* with context, not replace it
- Information moves in fragments, interruptions, and reactions

### Avoid
- Monologues
- Lecture‑responses
- Characters explaining things everyone present already knows

### Use
- Questions prompted by uncertainty
- Objects, screens, or actions anchoring discussion
- Subtext: what is not said or deliberately ignored

---

## Worldbuilding Method

- Delivered through aftermath, policy, habit, and scarcity
- Institutions are shown operating under justifiable strain or success, displaying moral erosion or integrity
- Large‑scale events are often first encountered indirectly

The reader understands the world because characters must *cope* with it.

---

## Pacing & Escalation

- Early clarity enables later chaos
- Escalation feels inevitable, not surprising
- Quiet scenes carry latent pressure from unresolved systems

Avoid power inflation. Growth is procedural, not exponential.

---

## Anti‑Patterns (Hard Avoid)

- Protagonist‑centric causality
- Expository dialogue
- Weightless violence
- Moral authorial commentary
- Setting that exists only as backdrop

---

## Syntax & Rhetoric Guardrails

### Forbidden Construction: The Binary Negation (The "Not X, but Y" Trap)
- Never describe an action by what it is not. If a character doesn't do something, don't mention the action at all. Focus only on the kinetic reality.
- Prohibited Pattern: "He didn't just walk; he stalked." / "It wasn't a sound, but a vibration."
- Reason: This is jarring, repetitive, and breaks immersion by referencing what isn't happening.
- Replacement: Commit to the active verb or the specific noun immediately.

- Instead of: "It wasn't a scream, but a low whistle."
- Use: "A low whistle cut through the silence."

### Elimination of Filter Words

- Prohibited Pattern: "He saw the light flicker." / "She heard the door creak." / "He felt the cold air."
- Reason: These words remind the reader they are reading a story about a character's senses, rather than experiencing the senses directly.

- Replacement: Remove the filter and describe the sensory event as the primary action.

- Instead of: "He felt the heavy vibration of the mag-lev."
- Use: "The mag-lev’s vibration hummed through the soles of his boots."

- Instead of: "He noticed the principal was sweating."
- Use: "Beads of sweat pooled on the principal’s upper lip."

### Avoid Overly Theatrical Adverbs

Use sparingly the adverbs that attempt to add "weight" (e.g., grimly, violently, suddenly, desperately) or "urgency" (e.g. suddenly, abruptly, instantly, slowly, immediately). Let the Procedural Cost and Physicality blocks communicate the stakes.

## Quality Control Checklist

- [ ] World events exist beyond protagonist action
- [ ] Consequences persist across scenes
- [ ] Information is inferred, not declared
- [ ] Physical cost is present
- [ ] Dialogue competes with environment
- [ ] Scene changes something irreversible

## The Skill In Work (Summary Example)

### Narrative Prompt 

[The protagonist and the blue-haired girl enter the high school auditorium. The students are whispering because they recognize her. The principal is nervous and tries to introduce them, but the protagonist just wants to start the lecture.]

### The Transformation (Applying SKILL.md)
- **Orientation & Spatial Anchor** The heavy oak doors of the auditorium swung inward, the hinges letting out a dry, rhythmic groan that cut through the low murmur of the crowd. Inside, the heat was stagnant, smelling of floor wax and recycled breath. A flickering fluorescent tube in the back row buzzed with a sharp, electric irregularity—an independent pulse in the humid quiet.

- **Perceptual Filter & Identification Protocol** A funnel of four hundred students sat in the dim light, their collective attention shifting toward the entrance like a physical weight. The man in the charcoal suit stepped onto the stage, the heels of his shoes striking the floorboards with a hollow, echoing thwack. He placed a black, polymer case on the lectern. The latches released with a double clack—a mechanical sound that resonated against the wood.

Beside him stood the girl with the synthetic blue hair. She didn't look at the crowd; she kept her hands deep in the pockets of a coat made of wool so dark it seemed to absorb the yellow light of the room. In the third row, a student leaned back, the plastic of his chair creaking. He nudged his neighbor, nodding toward the girl’s lapel where a silver pin caught the light. The whispering rippled through the front rows—a low hiss of sibilant sounds that trailed off as she reached the center of the stage.

- **Dialogue Under Friction** "I... I would like to welcome our guests," the principal said, his voice cracking as he adjusted the microphone. Feedback shrieked through the house speakers, a sharp spike of sound that made the man on stage wince. The principal’s hand hovered near the blue-haired girl’s elbow, then pulled back as if the air around her were electrified.

"We're on a schedule," the man—Vane—said, his voice flat and unamplified. He didn't look at the principal. He pulled a slender, matte-black rod from the case and tapped a recessed button on the side. A faint violet glow bled into the glass apertures along its length, accompanied by a high-pitched whine. "The bridge transit grid defaulted to manual override. We lost twelve minutes. I’m starting now."

- **Outcome & Transition** The principal stepped back, his keys jingling as he retreated toward the wings. Vane adjusted the rod, the violet light casting long, jagged shadows across the front row. The clock on the back wall ticked over—09:12.
