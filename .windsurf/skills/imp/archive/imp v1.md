# Fiction Writing Skill: Systemic Realism & Immersive Prose

## Skill Summary

This skill applies **systemic, immersive realism** to fiction across genres. It focuses on believable worlds that progress independently of protagonists, action grounded in physical and logistical consequence, and prose that conveys meaning through behavior, environment, and aftermath rather than exposition.

Use this skill when writing, rewriting, or editing fiction that must feel *lived-in*, coherent under pressure, and resistant to common failures such as info-dumping, protagonist-centric plotting, or theatrical but weightless action.

## Core Principles (Non‑Negotiable)

1. **World Moves Without the Protagonist**  
   Events, institutions, and crises continue regardless of the main character’s presence or success. The narrative may intersect with them, but does not cause them to exist.

2. **Competence Without Exceptionalism**  
   Characters are trained, experienced, or practiced — not chosen, exempt, or narratively protected. Survival does not imply moral correctness.

3. **Action as Process, Not Spectacle**  
   Violence, crisis, and decision-making are treated as logistical sequences with cost, fatigue, injury, and imperfect outcomes.

4. **Show, Don’t Explain**  
   Information is conveyed through consequence, reaction, omission, and environment. Direct explanation is a last resort.

5. **Repeatable, Load‑Bearing Prose**  
   Sentence structure and descriptive density are designed to hold under sustained action, long projects, and frequent output.

## Narrative Perspective & Information Control

### Third‑Person, Limited by Perception
- Camera follows what can be reasonably perceived.
- No omniscient moral framing.
- Knowledge is partial, delayed, or inferred.

### Discovery Over Declaration
**Avoid:** “This was a trap.”  
**Use:** Physical or behavioral cues that allow the reader to reach that conclusion.

### Flawed Interpretation
Characters misread situations, act on bad assumptions, or lack context. The narrative does not correct them immediately.

---

## Physicality as the Translation Layer

All abstractions must be rendered physical.

### Emotion
- Fear → altered breathing, sensory overload
- Anger → narrowed attention, loss of fine control
- Shock → delay, ringing silence, slowed response

### Thought
Thinking is shown through hesitation, repetition, fixation, or premature action — not internal essays.

### Technology / Systems
Systems resist, lag, fail, or demand tradeoffs. Interaction has tactile or procedural markers.

## Scene Construction (Flexible Framework)

### 1. Orientation
- How the scene is entered (movement, interruption, aftermath)
- Spatial clarity: relative positions, materials, scale

### 2. Perceptual Filter
- What the POV character notices *first* and *misses entirely*
- Emotional or physical state shaping perception

### 3. Trigger
- The event that forces action, choice, or reaction

### 4. Sequence
- Actions tied to established space and constraints
- Costs accumulate (time, injury, exposure, resources)

### 5. Outcome
- What changed in the world
- What damage remains
- What was *not* resolved

### 6. Transition
- Movement, time lapse, or consequence carrying forward

---

## Dialogue: Information Under Friction

### Core Rules
- Dialogue exists to *collide* with context, not replace it
- Information moves in fragments, interruptions, and reactions

### Avoid
- Monologues
- Lecture‑responses
- Characters explaining things everyone present already knows

### Use
- Questions prompted by uncertainty
- Objects, screens, or actions anchoring discussion
- Subtext: what is not said or deliberately ignored

---

## Worldbuilding Method

- Delivered through aftermath, policy, habit, and scarcity
- Institutions are shown operating under strain or moral erosion
- Large‑scale events are often first encountered indirectly

The reader understands the world because characters must *cope* with it.

---

## Pacing & Escalation

- Early clarity enables later chaos
- Escalation feels inevitable, not surprising
- Quiet scenes carry latent pressure from unresolved systems

Avoid power inflation. Growth is procedural, not exponential.

---

## Anti‑Patterns (Hard Avoid)

- Protagonist‑centric causality
- Expository dialogue
- Weightless violence
- Moral authorial commentary
- Setting that exists only as backdrop

---

## Quality Control Checklist

- [ ] World events exist beyond protagonist action
- [ ] Consequences persist across scenes
- [ ] Information is inferred, not declared
- [ ] Physical cost is present
- [ ] Dialogue competes with environment
- [ ] Scene changes something irreversible
