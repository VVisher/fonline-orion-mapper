The Station
A ventilation fan behind the rusted grate of the north wall turned with a rhythmic, grinding screech—metal on warped metal—every four seconds. The sound cut through the damp heat of the platform, keeping time with the drip of condensation falling from the vaulted ceiling onto the yellow safety line. The air smelled of ozone, stale urine, and the copper tang of brake dust.

The man in the oversized surplus jacket shifted his weight against the tiled pillar. The canvas duffel bag slung across his chest pulled the strap taut against his trapezius, the nylon digging in. He adjusted the grip, his fingers white-knuckled and stiff from twenty minutes of static tension. Inside the bag, the angular density of the plating pressed against his ribs with every breath. A bead of sweat traced a cold line down his spine, unrelated to the humidity.

At the turnstiles, the flow of commuters bottled up. Two officers in riot-grade polycarbonate vests stood by the ticket readers, their scanners chirping at random intervals. They did not look at the crowd; they looked at the readouts. A woman with a stroller struggled to bypass the checkpoint, creating a wedge of friction that slowed the line to a standstill. The man by the pillar checked the analog watch on his wrist. The second hand ticked past the twelve. 14:02. The schedule had slipped.
Air pressure pushed through the tunnel first, carrying a blast of grit and warm wind. The platform lights flickered—a brownout caused by the approaching power draw. The crowd surged forward, ignoring the yellow line, their bodies pressing together in a wave of collective indifference to the safety warnings.

The train emerged from the dark, the single headlight sweeping across the graffiti on the far wall. The brakes engaged—a high-pitched shriek that vibrated through the soles of the man's boots.

The lead car passed. Then the second.

The deceleration curve was aggressive. The train ground to a halt with the fourth car centered on the platform, misaligned with the waiting crowd. The hydraulic systems hissed, discharging pressure.

The doors remained shut.

Inside the car, the overhead lighting strips were dead. Through the grime-streaked glass, movement obscured the view—not the seated shapes of commuters, but the upright, rigid silhouettes of figures holding stabilization straps.

The man in the surplus jacket did not step forward. He took a half-step back, putting the pillar between himself and the glass.

The speaker system above the platform clicked. Static burst out, followed by a flat, pre-recorded chime. The ventilation fan ground out another screech in the silence that followed.

The doors on the opposite side of the train—facing the maintenance wall—slid open.
