The hydration unit against the tiled wall shuddered. Clunk. Hiss. The compressor kicked in, vibrating the loose panel on its side, before dying into a low, rattling wheeze. Condensation dripped from the plastic dispensing slot to the concrete floor, forming a dark, sticky circle that the automated sweeper-drone had missed three times.

The air in the station tasted of recycled copper and damp wool. Kael shifted his weight. The strap of the canvas bag had compressed the blood flow in his left shoulder, leaving the arm dead and prickling with static pins. He adjusted the load, moving it from his hip to the bench. The bag hit the metal seat with a dense, wet thud.

Ten yards away, two figures in Enforcer fatigues walked past the turnstiles. They looked at their scanners, then at the clock. One of them yawned, the jaw stretching wide, before they turned the corner toward the upper levels. Kael watched the empty corridor where they had vanished. He wiped his palm against his trousers. It left a faint, damp streak on the fabric.

A vibration traveled up through the soles of his boots. The lights overhead flickered—once, twice—responding to the power draw of the approaching line. Wind pushed through the tunnel, carrying the smell of ozone and brake dust.

The train slid into the station, a wall of scarred silver metal decelerating with a high-pitched scream of friction. The doors hissed open.

Kael stood up. He scanned the third car. A cluster of commuters exited, eyes fixed on floor tiles or handheld screens, moving around him like water around a stone. The platform cleared. The "Doors Closing" chime rang out—a cheerful, synthetic three-note melody.

The car was empty.

Kael stepped forward. The bag swung against his leg. He looked past the dirty glass of the doors. On the floor of the carriage, between the rows of orange seats, a single yellow safety vest lay crumpled in a heap. A dark liquid was spreading from beneath it, tracking with the motion of the idling train.

Clunk. Hiss. The hydration unit cycled again behind him.

The doors slammed shut.
