Good prompt. It’s exactly the kind that usually collapses into melodrama or exposition. I’ll apply SKILL_MASTER v2 fully and let the scene carry itself. No meta commentary inside the text.

The city clung to the cliff like a habit that had grown too deep to break. Stone terraces stepped downward toward the sea, roofs overlapping, gutters feeding into one another until the runoff vanished into mist. By dawn, the bells had already rung twice—once for the tide schedule, once for the birth.

The hunter didn’t go inside right away.

He set his spear against the outer wall and worked the grit from its head with a cloth, slow and methodical. The iron held a nick from yesterday’s work, small enough to ignore for now. The goats on the lower terraces were already awake, their bells clinking out of rhythm with the city’s.

From inside the house came a thin sound. Not a cry. Something smaller, uneven.

He finished the spear, leaned it where it always stood, and washed his hands in the basin by the door. The water darkened, then cleared. He dried them on his trousers before stepping in.

The room smelled of boiled linen and resin. A charm burned low near the window, its glow steady, doing its quiet work against fever. His wife sat upright on the bed, hair loose over her shoulders, her face drawn tight in a way he recognized from long marches and worse returns. The midwife was already packing her things.

The first two girls slept in the corner, bundled together, unaware of anything that might matter later.

The third lay between them.

He did not reach for her.

Small horns pressed faint shadows into the cloth near her temples, not grown yet, just enough to catch the light when the charm flickered. One forearm rested outside the wrap; the skin there was darker, patterned faintly, like scales beneath frost. When she shifted, the fabric at her back lifted, then settled again, as if something beneath it had tried to unfold and failed.

The hunter stood still. Long enough that the midwife cleared her throat.

“She’s breathing clean,” the woman said. “Heart’s strong. Whatever she is, it’s not killing her.”

He nodded once. That was information. Not reassurance.

The midwife left. The door closed behind her with the soft, final sound of custom fulfilled.

His wife spoke first.

It came out in pieces. The long season he’d been gone. The caravan guard with the gold-threaded cloak. The ward he’d worn against cold iron, not against charm. How it hadn’t mattered, not after the wine. Not after the spell had taken.

She cried when she said the last part. Not loudly. The way people did when they already knew what tears couldn’t fix.

The hunter listened. He didn’t interrupt. When she finished, he crossed the room and sat on the stool by the wall, the one he used to mend gear.

Outside, the bells rang again.

“She stays,” his wife said, too quickly. Then slower. “Please.”

He looked at the child again. The horns were warmer now, a faint sheen of heat where they touched the cloth. He imagined how that would feel in winter. In summer.

“She stays,” he said, after a while.

His wife exhaled hard, as if she’d been holding it since before dawn. She reached for his sleeve. He let her, briefly, then stood.

—

The next day, the city woke to weather moving in from the sea. Low clouds pressed against the cliff face, dampening sound. The hunter brought in his catch early and cleaned it behind the house. The blade slipped once and bit his thumb. He sucked the blood away and bound it without thought.

Inside, the baby fussed. Not crying. Testing.

He dried his hands and went in.

His wife stood by the cradle, rocking it with one foot while she sorted herbs on the table. When she saw him, she paused, waiting.

“She stays,” he said again, because things said once didn’t always hold.

He reached into the pouch at his belt and set two small items on the table: a river-stone charm against sickness, and a thin iron token stamped with the city mark.

“For food,” he said. “And the charm might help.”

Her shoulders loosened.

“That’s all,” he added.

She looked up.

“I’ll hunt,” he continued. “I’ll bring in what I bring in. I won’t lie if someone asks. I won’t fight what comes for her. Magic, blood, wings—none of that is mine.”

The baby made a small sound then, sharp enough to cut through the room. One tiny hand slipped free of the wrap, fingers flexing, the skin there dark and faintly ridged.

The hunter didn’t look away. He just didn’t move toward her, either.

“I won’t decide her path,” he said. “And I won’t stand in it.”

His wife nodded once. Not agreement. Understanding.

Outside, the bells rang for the tide again. The city leaned into the cliff, as it always had, holding fast and letting whatever came next find its own way in.
